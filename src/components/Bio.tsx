      <p>Software engineer, athlete, data scientist, record collector, bone broth enthusiast, wearer of many hats. I strive to build human-first tech relevant to our ever-changing times. I have successfully developed and launched several cutting-edge applications, such as the first NFT album and the first decentralized music application on Ethereum. I have recruited and mentored a talented technical team and managed the product lifecycle from MVP to scaling.</p>
      <p>In my last role as co-founder and CTO of a community engagement protocol at <a href="https://mochi.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mochi.game</a>, we empowered communities to train their own artificial intelligences. I am passionate about creating innovative and engaging experiences that help organizations improve their collaboration, communication, and culture. With over 6 years of experience in fullstack engineering, product development, and team leadership, with a focus on blockchain, web, and data technologies, I am looking forward to my next challenge.</p>
